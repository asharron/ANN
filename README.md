# ANN
This is a hand made ANN to help me familiarize myself with how a neural network works

#How to use it
weights.in is the file that will have the layout of the neural network. 3 6 2 will make an ANN that will have 3 input nodes, 6
nodes for the hidden layer, and have 2 nodes for the output layer. The weights will then be initalized to what the file has.
To run the file, just python3 main.py in your terminal.

#Output
The program will print out what input you placed in it, then output the error of each node, the error of each weight,
then what the newly trained weights are.
